1 Game
Question 1 Design a minimalist 3D game of your choice.
The subject of your game is free but must contain at least two different graphics programs.
Possible project ideas: Car or character moving on a terrain, spaceships, first-person view movement in a 3D world, etc. You can add various effects such as the ability to fire projectiles, manage collisions between several objects, manage time and animations, manage the camera or interact with the user using the keyboard or mouse (see GLut function documentation).
Notes Remember that a rotation is always applied around the origin, so it is necessary to translate the object if you want to rotate it around another point such as its centre, for example.
âš« Keep things simple at first.
- Pay particular attention to the movements of your objects as well as the possible movement of your camera. Define your reference points and make diagrams.
- In the case of collision management think about how to detect collisions approx- imatively.
Render your work in the form of an archive containing:
- All your source files (.cpp, .hpp, shaders).
- All your data (textures, mesh files, etc).
- A concise report explaining what you have done (5 to 10 pages). Take care to illustrate your report with screenshots of your game, together with explanations of the methods you have used. For geometric approaches, prefer explanations in the form of diagrams rather than long paragraphs.
You can delete the build folder and the extern folder.
